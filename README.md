# calculator-js

Calculator-js is a learning project written in Javascript and Bootstrap. I tried to reproduce Mac OS Calculator application.
My version can perform the four basic operations â€“ addition, subtracting, multiplication and division. 
The work is not done and calculatore still has some critical issues with float numbers, percentage and other functionality. Layout is also not perferct.
I would really appreciate any feedback and code review.
